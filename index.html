  <h2> What our product contains </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <paragraph class="stuff"> Our product contains 1 cylinder holder, and we covered the succulent stem with foil so that could hold the soil and succulent, and the soil woudn't mix with the sand! For the medium size, we used 2 candle holders, one big ande one snall, and the small one holds the succulent and soil. The medium size is basically the small size, but no foil. That is what our product contains!</paragraph>
